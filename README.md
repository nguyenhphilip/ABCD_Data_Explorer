# ABCD Data Explorer
This is the code for the ABCD Data Explorer app. To run it, open the project in R Studio and hit 'Run App' (make sure to run it externally).
It's still very much a prototype, but the code is here for others to play with.

The way our data is organized is by category. Within each category are individual csv files that ultimately get merged, based on whichever spreadsheets and variables you need.
