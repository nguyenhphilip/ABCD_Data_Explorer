# ABCD Data Explorer
This is the code for the ABCD Data Builder app. (for release 4.0)

The app helps with exploring, cleaning, and downloading a dataset that will be analyzed.

 Note: This assumes you have access to the ABCD data (the raw text files downloaded from the data release)

To run it:

- clone this Github repo (i.e. download all the files here) 
- open the project in R Studio
- ensure that you have the `ui.r`, `server.r`, and `global.r` files in the same folder
- create a folder named 'data' within the same folder as `ui.r`, `server.r`, and `global.r`
- put all of your ABCD data that you want loaded in the app in the 'data' folder
- hit 'Run App' (make sure it is ran externally - see the little arrow next to 'Run App'). 

It's still very much a prototype, but the code is here for others to play with.
