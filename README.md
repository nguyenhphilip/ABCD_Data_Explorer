# ABCD Data Explorer
This is the code for the ABCD Data Builder app. Version 1.0 (data release 3.0)

To run it, open the project in R Studio, ensure that you have the `ui.r`, `server.r`, and `global.r` files in the same folder, and hit 'Run App' (make sure to run it externally). You also need your ABCD data (the raw text files downloaded from the data release) inside a folder titled `data`.

It's still very much a prototype, but the code is here for others to play with.
